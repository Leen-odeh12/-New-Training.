Components are the building blocks of creating User Interfaces(UI) in React. There are two possible ways to create a component.

1-Function Components: This is the simplest way to create a component. 
Those are pure JavaScript functions that accept props object as the first parameter and return React elements to render the output:

function Greeting({ message }) {
  return <h1>{`Hello, ${message}`}</h1>;
}

-------
2- Class Components: You can also use ES6 class to define a component. The above function component can be written as a class component:

class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>{`Hello, ${this.props.message}`}</h1>;
  }
}
