State of a component is an object that holds some information that may change over the lifetime of the component. 
The important point is whenever the state object changes, the component re-renders. 
It is always recommended to make our state as simple as possible and minimize the number of stateful components.

Let's take an example of User component with message state.
Here, useState hook has been used to add state to the User component and it returns an array with current state and function to update it.

import React, { useState } from "react";

function User() {
  const [message, setMessage] = useState("Welcome to React world");

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{message}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
