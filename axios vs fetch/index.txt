What's the difference between axios and fetch which are used for making HTTP requests from a web browser?

ans:-

1.Syntax and ease of use:
Axios: Axios provides a simple and intuitive syntax for making HTTP requests. It uses promises and provides a higher level of abstraction, allowing you to write cleaner code.
Fetch: Fetch is a built-in web API in modern browsers that provides a native way to make HTTP requests. Its syntax is a bit more verbose and requires additional steps to handle response data.

2.Browser support:
Axios: Axios supports all major browsers, including older versions.
Fetch: Fetch is supported by most modern browsers, but it may require a polyfill or transpiler to work with older browsers.

3.Request and response handling:
Axios: Axios provides built-in request and response interceptors, allowing you to easily modify requests or responses. It also supports automatic transformation of request and response data, such as JSON parsing or serialization.
Fetch: Fetch provides a lower-level API and does not have built-in interceptors. You need to manually handle request and response modifications. It also requires additional steps to parse or serialize data.

4.Error handling:
Axios: Axios has built-in error handling and automatically rejects the promise on HTTP error status codes (e.g., 404 or 500). It also allows you to define global error handling for all requests.
Fetch: Fetch does not reject the promise on HTTP error status codes by default. You need to check the response status manually and handle errors accordingly.

5.Cross-origin requests:
Axios: Axios supports cross-origin requests by default and handles CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers automatically.
Fetch: Fetch also supports cross-origin requests but requires explicit handling of CORS headers and may involve additional configuration.

--------
In summary, Axios provides a more user-friendly and feature-rich API for making HTTP requests. 
It offers better error handling, automatic data transformation, and built-in interceptors. Fetch, on the other hand, is a native browser API with a lower-level interface and
requires more manual handling for certain tasks.
